## Description
This project focuses on fine-tuning state-of-the-art Text-to-Speech (TTS) models for two main objectives: enhancing pronunciation of technical jargon in English and synthesizing high-quality speech in a selected regional language. The goal is to optimize TTS models for accurate pronunciation in technical interviews and improve speech synthesis quality for diverse language speakers.

## Objectives
- **Task 1:** Fine-tune a TTS model for English technical vocabulary (e.g., "API," "CUDA").
- **Task 2:** Fine-tune a TTS model for a regional language of your choice.
- **Bonus Task:** Implement techniques for fast inference, including quantization and pruning.

## Model Selection
- **TTS Models Used:** Coqui TTS or SpeechT5 for English, with a choice of Coqui TTS, SpeechT5, or Bark for regional language synthesis.

## Dataset
### English Technical Vocabulary
- A dataset containing technical terms and general English sentences sourced from technical blogs and interview transcripts.

### Regional Language
- A dataset for the selected regional language sourced from VoxPopuli, CommonVoice, or custom recordings.

## Installation
To set up this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Fine-Tuning the English TTS Model:**
   ```python
   # Example code for fine-tuning
   from tts_model import fine_tune_model
   fine_tune_model('english', dataset='path_to_dataset')
   ```

2. **Fine-Tuning the Regional Language TTS Model:**
   ```python
   # Example code for fine-tuning
   fine_tune_model('regional_language', dataset='path_to_dataset')
   ```

3. **Evaluating Model Performance:**
   ```python
   # Example code for evaluation
   evaluate_model('english')
   evaluate_model('regional_language')
   ```

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS):** To measure the naturalness of speech.
- **Pronunciation Accuracy:** Comparing synthesized speech with expected outputs.

## Results
Detailed results and analysis of the fine-tuned models will be included in the final report, highlighting performance improvements over pre-trained models.
